# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to optimize the Gestione Pazienti SPA by removing dead code, eliminating redundancies, and implementing performance optimizations. The application currently suffers from bundle size issues, duplicate CSS imports, excessive console logging, and unused code that impacts loading performance on Netlify. The optimization will focus on maintaining functionality while significantly improving build size and runtime performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove dead code and unused files, so that the codebase is cleaner and the bundle size is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN all unused files SHALL be removed from the final bundle
2. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN no empty or unreferenced files SHALL exist
3. WHEN examining imports THEN all imported modules SHALL be actually used in the code
4. WHEN checking feature flags THEN only implemented features SHALL have corresponding flags
5. WHEN reviewing test files THEN only active test files SHALL remain in the repository

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate CSS bundle duplication, so that the application loads faster and uses less bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bootstrap CSS is imported THEN it SHALL be imported only once through SCSS modules
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN no duplicate CSS rules SHALL exist in the final bundle
3. WHEN analyzing the CSS output THEN the total CSS bundle size SHALL be reduced by at least 30%
4. WHEN styles are loaded THEN both desktop and mobile styles SHALL work correctly
5. WHEN examining SCSS imports THEN Bootstrap components SHALL be selectively imported based on actual usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement production-ready logging, so that console statements don't appear in the production build.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in production THEN console.log and console.warn statements SHALL be removed
2. WHEN errors occur THEN console.error statements SHALL still be preserved for debugging
3. WHEN in development mode THEN all logging SHALL function normally
4. WHEN implementing the logger service THEN it SHALL conditionally log based on environment
5. WHEN building for production THEN the build process SHALL automatically strip development logs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the Vite build configuration, so that the application builds more efficiently and loads faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build runs THEN manual chunks SHALL be properly configured for optimal loading
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN tree shaking SHALL be enabled and working effectively
3. WHEN building for production THEN console statements SHALL be automatically removed
4. WHEN examining the build output THEN bundle analysis SHALL be available
5. WHEN optimizing dependencies THEN unnecessary force rebuilds SHALL be eliminated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Netlify optimizations, so that the deployed application has optimal caching and compression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are served THEN they SHALL have appropriate cache headers for long-term caching
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN CSS and JS files SHALL be minified and compressed
3. WHEN users access the application THEN static assets SHALL be served with immutable cache headers
4. WHEN examining network requests THEN asset compression SHALL be enabled
5. WHEN the build deploys THEN processing optimizations SHALL be applied automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize import statements, so that only necessary code is included in the bundle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing Bootstrap components THEN only used components SHALL be imported
2. WHEN examining third-party imports THEN they SHALL be as specific as possible
3. WHEN analyzing the bundle THEN unused exports SHALL not be included
4. WHEN implementing lazy loading THEN error handling SHALL be included for failed imports
5. WHEN reviewing imports THEN all import paths SHALL be optimized for tree shaking

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement bundle analysis tools, so that I can monitor and maintain optimal bundle sizes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build THEN a bundle analysis report SHALL be generated
2. WHEN examining the analysis THEN it SHALL show gzipped sizes for realistic performance metrics
3. WHEN the analysis completes THEN it SHALL automatically open for review
4. WHEN monitoring bundle size THEN the analysis SHALL identify the largest dependencies
5. WHEN optimizing further THEN the analysis SHALL provide actionable insights for size reduction
